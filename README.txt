Game tracker web
====================================
A web application to track the games I played and I am currently playing. This is just a little demo to practise my 
frontend skills and at the same time this helps me to improve a proyect that I am working on.


Features:
.- Game list: The webpage displays a little list of games in which we can find.
	.- The games I have completed

	TODO: .- Add in the game list the games I am currently playing (with a progress bar) and the games I have dropped.
	      .- Add a section to see the full list

 This list has a cronological order and it shows just some of them. We can find a link to show the complete list 
with more detail next to the list.

.- Interactive Elements: The website has a couple of interactive elements using JavaScript.

Now I am working on: 
	.- Doing the responsive design

Tecnologies:
.- HTML5
.- CSS3
.- JavaScript
